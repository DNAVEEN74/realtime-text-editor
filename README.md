# CollabEdit

## Description

**CollabEdit** is a real-time collaborative text editor that enables users to create and manage documents with ease. Users can sign up or log in to start creating unique documents, switch between previously created projects, and collaborate in real time by sharing a session ID. Contributors can join the session without needing an account, and all participants can download the document as a PDF. Sessions automatically expire when the document owner closes the browser tab.
